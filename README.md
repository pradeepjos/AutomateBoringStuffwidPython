# AutomateBoringStuffwidPython :) 
This repo is a collection of multiple coding exercises which I worked on while taking the course "Automate Boring Stuff with Python by AL Sweigart".

# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

- *Beautiful is better than ugly.*
- *Explicit is better than implicit.*
- *Simple is better than complex.*
- *Complex is better than complicated.*
- *Flat is better than nested.*
- *Sparse is better than dense.*
- *Readability counts.*
- *Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.*
- *Although practicality beats purity.*
- *Errors should never pass silently.*
- *Unless explicitly silenced.*
- *In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.*
- *There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.*
- *Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.*
- *Now is better than never.*
- *Although never is often better than *right* now.*
- *If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.*
- *If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.*
- *Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!*
